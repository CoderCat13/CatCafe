<h2>Why invest in the Cat Cafe?</h2>
<p>The Cat Cafe uses environmentally friendly supplies and creates a social gathering for both cats and humans. Our market will be large because 29% of Americans own a cat and a whopping 64% drink coffee.</p>
<p> 34,700 people live in Pleasant Hill, 68,500 live in Walnut Creek, and 126,000 live in Lafayette. That gives us 235,000 people in the area near the Cat Cafe's planned location.  An estimated 68, 150 cat owners are in the area. If only 5% of the potential market gets a monthly membership to the Cat Cafe, that gives us $68,000 a month.</p>
<p> I am the right person to invest in because even though I am a young entrepreneur, I have an amazing, multitasking, Mom and a Dad and Grandpa who know how to do business. They have taught me some of what they know and now I am confident this will be a successful business. My investment goal is $5,000.</p>
